## üí° ASSIGNMENT BEST PRACTICES

- Prioritize same city/pincode assignments
- Consider travel time and distance

### 2. Workload Balancing
- Check current active orders before assignment
- Distribute orders evenly among available pickup boys
- Monitor weekly completion rates

### 3. Time Slot Optimization
- Group orders by time slots
- Assign morning orders to early-available pickup boys
- Consider pickup boy's preferred working hours

### 4. Automated vs Manual
- Use auto-assignment for routine, location-based assignments
- Use manual assignment for special cases or VIP customers
- Bulk assignment for processing large backlogs
